# OPENtransformer Core Modules

OPENtransformer is organized into several core modules, each handling specific functionality. This document provides an overview of each module and links to detailed documentation.

## Available Modules

### 1. [Diffusion Models](diffusion.md)
The diffusion module provides access to state-of-the-art image generation models. Key features include:
- Text-to-image generation
- Image-to-image transformation
- Model management and optimization
- Custom pipeline support

### 2. [Chat Models](chat.md)
The chat module enables natural language interactions with various language models. Features include:
- Conversation management
- Context handling
- Multiple model support
- Streaming responses

### 3. [Vision Models](vision.md)
The vision module offers comprehensive image analysis capabilities:
- Image classification
- Object detection
- Feature extraction
- Image processing utilities

### 4. [Multimodal Models](multimodal.md)
The multimodal module combines vision and language capabilities:
- Image-text understanding
- Visual question answering
- Cross-modal retrieval
- Joint embedding generation

## Module Integration

Modules are designed to work together seamlessly. Here's an example of combining multiple modules:

```python
from OPENtransformer import EasyDiffusionAPI, LLMAPI, EasyImage, MultimodalAnalysis

# Generate an image
diffusion = EasyDiffusionAPI()
image = diffusion.generate_image("A futuristic cityscape")

# Analyze the generated image
vision = EasyImage()
analysis = vision.analyze_image(image)

# Get a detailed description
chat = LLMAPI()
description = chat.generate_description(analysis)

# Perform multimodal analysis
multimodal = MultimodalAnalysis()
insights = multimodal.analyze(image, description)
```

## Module Dependencies

Each module has its own set of dependencies, which are automatically installed when you install OPENtransformer. However, you can install specific modules separately if needed:

```bash
# Install all modules
pip install OPENtransformer

# Install specific modules
pip install OPENtransformer[diffusion]
pip install OPENtransformer[chat]
pip install OPENtransformer[vision]
pip install OPENtransformer[multimodal]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Resource Management**
   - Initialize models only when needed
   - Use context managers for resource cleanup
   - Monitor memory usage with large models

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling for each module
   - Use try-except blocks for model operations
   - Handle API rate limits and timeouts

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use appropriate batch sizes
   - Enable caching where available
   - Utilize GPU acceleration when possible

4. **Model Selection**
   - Choose models based on your specific needs
   - Consider model size and resource requirements
   - Balance between speed and quality
